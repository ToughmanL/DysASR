COLLEGE FOOTBALL IS MY FAVORITE SPORT AND I GUESS THE ONE RULE THAT I FIND MOST ENTERTAINING IS THE RULE THERE'S RECEIVER MUST PLACE ONE FOOT IN BOUNDS BEFORE GOING OUT OF BOUNDS WHEN RECEIVING OR CATCHING A PASS IT PROVIDES A LOT OF EXCITEMENT AND GOOD ARGUMENTS BETWEEN RIVALS WATCHING THE GAME WITH YOU
WE WOULD MUCH PREFER THE DANGERS OF ACTUAL WARFARE TO THIS UNSOLDIERLY METHOD OF SUBDUING THE VILLAGE
THE STEPS TO MAKING MY FAVORITE SANDWICH ARE PRETTY SIMPLE COMMA JUST USING BREAD WITH MAYONNAISE WARM SOME SLICED HAM WITH CHEDDAR CHEESE SLICES ON TOP IN THE MICROWAVE AND THEN PLACE IT ON THE BREAD AND VOILA LUNCH IS SERVED

I THINK THE FOOD THAT I MOST HATED AS A CHILD WAS A BOLOGNA SANDWICH WITH MUSTARD BECAUSE MY MOTHER USED TO PACK THAT IN MY LUNCH BOX AND THERE WAS NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOLOGNA SANDWICH WITH MUSTARD ON WHITE BREAD CAUSE THE MUSTARD WOULD MAKE THE BREAD ALL SOGGY AND THEN I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT THEY PUT IN BOLOGNA THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST A DISASTER AND I COULD ONLY HOPE THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO MAKE UP FOR IT LIKE A RING DING OR A YODEL IN MY LUNCHBOX TO MAKE UP FOR THAT HORRIBLE BOLOGNA SANDWICH ANYWAY I QUESTION NOW WHY I MIGHT HAVE PARKINSON'S IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE RING DING OR THE YODEL BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY PRESERVATIVES IN THOSE TWINKIES I THINK THE TWINKIES FROM THE SIXTIES WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE AROUND TODAY IF FOUND IN THE DIRT BECAUSE THEY WOULD STILL BE PRESERVED

MY FAVORITE BOARD GAME IS STRATOMATIC IT'S BASEBALL I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE I WAS A BOY WHEN I GOT MY FIRST COPY OF IT YOU DEVELOP THE LINEUPS AND THEN YOU ROLL THE DICE WITH EACH BATTER AND IT LINKS YOU UP WITH A RESPONSE AND SO THERE'S SOME CHANCE INVOLVED BUT IT'S BASICALLY A RECAPITULATION OF THE ACTUAL GAME SO
THE MOST MEANINGFUL GIFT I'VE EVER BEEN GIVEN IS THE GIFT OF LIFE WHICH MY PARENTS GAVE ME AND THEY NOT ONLY GAVE ME THE GIFT OF LIFE BUT THEY GAVE ME A WONDERFUL UPBRINGING WHERE I FELT UNCONDITIONALLY LOVED AND KNEW THAT EVERYTHING WAS GONNA TURN OUT ALRIGHT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND IT STAYED WITH ME AND I STILL DON'T HAVE LOTS OF ANXIETY ABOUT THE FUTURE EVEN THOUGH THE FUTURE DOES NOT REALLY LOOK VERY BRIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE EYES OF SOMEBODY WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE I STILL VIEW THE FUTURE AS BEING BRIGHT THANKS TO MY PARENTS SO THAT'S THE GREATEST GIFT IS ATTITUDE
